# Day 1 of Statistics

## What is Statistics?
Statistics is the art of learning from data. It is concerned with the collection of data, their subsequent description, and their analysis which often leads to the drawing of a conclusion.

## Major Branches of Statistics
- **Description:** concerned with description and summarization of data. Called descriptive statistics.
- **Inference:** concerned with drawing conclusions from data.
- To be able to draw conclusions from the data, we must take into account the possibility of chance - introduction to probability.

## Population and Sample
![Population and Sample](https://github.com/amit-timalsina/Statistics-101/blob/master/objects/population%26sample.png)
- **Population:** The total collection of all the elements that we are interested in is called a population.
- **Sample:** A representative subgroup of the population that will be studied in detail is called a sample.

## Purpose of Statistical Analysis
- If the purpose of the analysis is to examine and explore information for its own intrinsic interest only, the study is **descriptive**.
- If the information is obtained from a sample of the population and the purpose of the study is to use that information to draw conclusions about the population, the study is **inferential**.
- A descriptive study may be performed either on a sample or on a population.
